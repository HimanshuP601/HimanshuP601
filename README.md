# 👋 Hi, I'm Himanshu Parate

🎯 **Final-Year B.Tech CSE | Red Teaming | Malware Development | Offensive Security Enthusiast**

I’m a passionate cybersecurity learner with hands-on experience in red team tooling, reverse engineering, malware analysis, and CTFs. I break things to understand them — and sometimes, to build even stronger versions.

## 🧰 Focus Areas

- 🐍 Malware Development (C, Python, Shellcode Crafting)
- 🧬 Reverse Engineering (PE/ELF formats, x64dbg, Ghidra)
- 🧠 Manual Shellcode Execution (PEB, API Hashing, Windows Internals)
- ⚔️ Red Team Tool Building (Process Injection, DLL Loaders, Keyloggers)
- 🕸️ Bug Bounty & Recon Automation (Subdomain enum, web testing)
- 🎮 Game Modding (DLL Injection, AOB scanning/mods)
