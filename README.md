# 👋 Hi, I'm Himanshu Parate

🎯 **Final-Year B.Tech CSE | Red Teaming | Malware Development | Offensive Security Enthusiast**

I’m a passionate cybersecurity learner with hands-on experience in red team tooling, reverse engineering, malware analysis, and CTFs. I break things to understand them — and sometimes, to build even stronger versions.
